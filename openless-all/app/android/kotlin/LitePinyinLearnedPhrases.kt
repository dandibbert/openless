 * [PROMOTION_THRESHOLD] times, it "graduates" — LitePinyinRepository.query()
 * starts surfacing it (pinned first) whenever the user types "zgrm" from
 * scratch, the same effect a manually-curated whitelist entry would have,
 * except it only ever contains combos this specific user actually built up
 * themselves.
 *
 * Deliberately its own small store, not folded into LitePinyinUserFrequency
 * — that one ranks/reorders candidates already present in the static

 * the dictionary at all, gated by a hit-count threshold rather than a
