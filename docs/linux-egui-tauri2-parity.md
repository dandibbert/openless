# Linux egui / Tauri 2 parity tracker

This stack is maintained in PR #1060 (review baseline `227374ea`). Linux ships one
`openless-linux-egui` executable and does not link Tauri, Wry, or WebKitGTK.
Windows, macOS, and Android remain on Tauri.

## Implemented on the native Core 2.0 path

- eframe/egui 0.36.2 (wgpu 30.0.1, CPAL 0.18.2) shell, system CJK fallback, single instance, minimized
  startup, close-to-tray, safe shutdown, XDG autostart, notifications, external
  URLs, file dialogs, file logging, and diagnostic-log export
- fcitx5 dictation, QA, selection polish, translation, style switching, main
  window, style-pack direct, and applicable Coding Agent hotkeys; settings use
  strict collision checks; startup waits for plugin reload before registration
- CPAL recording with canonical WAV archives, Core retention policy, history
  playback/export and failed-session retranscription
- Native `mute_during_recording` (PipeWire `wpctl`/PulseAudio `pactl`) with
  guaranteed sink restore by RAII across stop/cancel/error/drop/shutdown
- Native recording start/stop audio cues synthesized to the default sink on a
  worker thread (never blocking the egui frame), gated by `audio_cue_on_record`
  and muted-aware (`audio_mute`/`audio_cue` modules)
- Core-backed history search/delete/clear/copy/re-polish/retranscribe, vocabulary,
  pending corrections, shared vocabulary presets, correction rules, and complete
  style-pack CRUD/reset/prompt diagnostics/ZIP import-export/direct hotkeys
- provider channel CRUD/order/enable/activation, credential metadata, endpoint,
  model listing, validation, and revision-aware settings conflict merging
- Remote Input TLS service, URLs, PIN, locale, connection count, and error events
- Marketplace list/detail/install/download/upload/update/delete, likes, authored
  packs, GitHub device flow, polling, cancel, and logout
- dictation, QA text/voice, selection polish preview/confirm/cancel/revert, and
  Less Computer text/voice/stream/tool approval/cancel through high-level Core APIs
- #997 native QA/selection/capsule popup design: same-executable re-entry,
  versioned serde JSONL, Markdown, drag/Esc, QA microphone and Enter submit,
  session/sequence/kind guards, nonblocking pipes, crash restart, and snapshot replay
- ~~stable/beta AppImage checks, scheduling, byte progress, SHA-256/minisign
  verification, atomic replace~~ — not ported: AppImage is retired from the Linux
  channel and deb/rpm cannot replace themselves, so the host keeps no update path
- Remote Input assets, shared icons, version parsing, packaging,
  and release workflow are independent of `src-tauri`

The backend host remains alive when its independent UI process closes. Internal
UI JSONL protocol v2 requires Hello/Ready, rejects mismatches, and resends bindings
and a full snapshot on reconnect. Explicit tray/launcher/open-window requests
create a missing UI or send FocusMain; Wayland activation remains compositor policy.
Core retains contract 2.0.0. Settings field patches are serialized and rebased onto
Core revisions; history and WAV probes run in one event-driven blocking task,
with cached results shared by History and Overview.

## Automated verification commands

- `cargo test -p openless-core --locked`
- `cargo test -p openless-linux-egui --locked --all-targets`
- `cargo clippy --locked -p openless-core --all-targets -- -D warnings`
- `cargo check --locked -p openless-linux-egui --all-targets`
- `cargo clippy --locked -p openless-linux-egui --all-targets -- -D warnings`
- PR #1019 Core/public-surface/dependency contract scripts
- fcitx5 C++ build plus `input_target_contract`
- `cargo tree` and release ELF `ldd` checks for Tauri/Wry/WebKitGTK
- Linux Tauri-free source, packaging, workflow, production-mock, capability, popup,
  settings-conflict, IPC handshake/reconnect, lifecycle, and staged-file gates

## Deliberate limits and device evidence still required

- fcitx5 is a startup requirement: missing addon, unavailable session D-Bus or
  failed required shortcut registration prevents Backend startup. An error window
  explains recovery; closing it exits nonzero while releasing the process lock.
  There is no IBus or global-hotkey fallback.
- Selection Voice remains hidden because the Linux production target/intent adapter
  is not implemented. It must not be advertised through capabilities. Selection
  polish and QA remain available.
- Local ASR is unsupported on Linux, including Generic Qwen, Foundry and MLX.
  No inference runtime is shipped; this is not an awaiting-device-verification item.
- Foreground-application identity and native post-insertion edit observation
  are explicit `Unsupported` on Linux: fcitx5 exposes surrounding text but no
  reliable app/control identity across X11/Wayland, PRIMARY cannot prove an
  original selection, and there is deliberately no IBus/global-hotkey fallback.
  The factory keeps Core's Noop HostContext/EditObservation adapters (reporting
  `source_app = None`) instead of faking edits. These are L02/L03 follow-ups,
  not simulated UI data or false capabilities.
- Mute/restore and start/stop cues are implemented (`audio_mute`/`audio_cue`),
  but the cpal cue-playback and real sink mute/restore paths still require
  X11/Wayland device runs before being recorded as verified; a Linux output
  stream is a PipeWire/KDE sink-input, so device evidence must confirm the cue
  does not disturb the session or trigger unexpected volume OSD.
- X11 and Wayland device runs are still required for focus, Unicode insertion,
  popup positioning, tray, fcitx5 reload/rebind, microphone unplug/recovery,
  Secret Service, real phone Remote Input, and startup failure/recovery. Ignored hardware tests or a green build are not
  recorded as device proof.

The automated scope is complete only when every command above passes at the
current PR #1060 head. The device-only rows remain “implemented, awaiting device
evidence” or “explicit unsupported” and must not be described as verified.
